		    <p>An interesting fact about Dubai: Dubai’s police force uses supercars to impress tourists and show how “classy” the city is.
This includes cars such as the Ferrari FF (US$ 500,000), Lamborghini Aventador (US$ 397,000) and an Aston Martin One-77 (US$ 1.79 million).
And they hold a world record for the fastest police car; a Bugatti Veyron which they purchased for US$ 1.6 million!
In comparison, attending New York University, the most expensive college in the USA, costs about $248,000 for four years!</p>            <p>Camel racing is a very popular sport in Dubai, similar to what football is to the USA and hockey to Canada.
Given the camel’s size, only children can participate in racing them. Instead of allowing Dubai residents’ children to participate, there has been a problem in the past with having children illegally trafficked into the country to race camels. The rest of the world eventually caught on to the issue and has since put a stop to it for the most part.
Leave it to Dubai to come up with a solution. Now, child-sized robots are being built and are racing the camels. They cost anywhere from $300 to $10,000

			<p>Things in Dubai always seem to have to be the biggest, the tallest or the most unique, so this latest development fits in perfectly.
Dubai Square, as it will be called, will be equivalent to the size of 100 football fields!
It is inspired by the world’s best shopping destinations such as London‘s Oxford Street and Los Angeles‘s Beverly Hills, but is said to become much more than just a shopping mall.
After reading all these other facts about Dubai I am sure you can expect this to have some unique, over the top features and be very entertaining<\p>

            <p>Known for its sustainability initiatives, Al Marmoom is abundant with native wildlife such as gazelles, camels and birds. Once considered globally extinct, the Arabian oryx has successfully been saved after breeding programmes and re-introductions in the UAE, including at Al Marmoom. To catch a glimpse of the elusive oryx, head over to their feeding stations around the area. 

 

If birdwatching is your passion, visit the nearby Al Qudra lakes, home to 170 bird species including some endangered kinds like the Steppe Eagle and the Asian Houbara. The calming waters of Al Qudra lakes are also a welcome spot for nature-lovers to enjoy a picnic. Early risers can head over at dawn to catch a glorious desert sunrise.</p>

			<p>This fan favourite may be tiny - its original Jumeirah branch has just five counter seats while a second outpost at Al Khawaneej is a tad bit bigger – but its fame ensures loyal diners are happy to take-away or eat in their cars. The High Jamz is a particular hit, with caramelised and crispy onions, Pepper Jack cheese, beef bacon and a ranch sauce melding together beautifully with the wagyu beef patty. Vegetarians are well served by the excellent aioli-topped King Shroom too.
			French Michelin starred chef Daniel Boulud is ironically best known for a dish that is decidedly all-American, the burger. He has appropriately titled his elevated take on the classic the Frenchie Burger au Feu de Bois – a juicy, wood-fired triumph with raclette cheese, onion and tomato compote and pickle sauce. This is the unabashedly fine dining take on the humble patty, and definitely worthy of a treat night.</p>
